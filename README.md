> ü§ñ **Hydrab0t** is essentially Jarvis for your team's GitHub workflow.

Some examples of what you can do:

- [Manage labels](#commands).
- [Set reminders](#commands).
- Automatically [create a new branch when an issue is assigned](docs/create-issue-branch.md).
- Trigger [deployments](docs/deployment.md) with labels.
- Enforce [PR  conventions](docs/validators.md#pull-requests).
- Notify of [failed guidelines](docs/#issues) when opening an issue.
- Schedule [detection for obsolete (stale) issues and pull requests](#docs/staleness) and notify author and collaborators.
- Get [weekly project summaries](docs/hydrabot-stats.md).
- And [more to come](#roadmap)

# Usage

1. [Install](https://github.com/apps/Hydrab0t) the Hydrab0t GitHub App to your repository.
2. [Create](#configuration) your play(s) in a playbook.
3. Commit and push the playbook to your repository at `.github/hydrabot.yml`

> ‚òù **NOTE:** You can also [deploy to your own server](docs/deploy.md).

# Configuration

**Hydrab0t** is **unbarred** when it comes to being configurable.
Define your plays by creating a playbook as `.github/hydrabot.yml` file in your repository.

## Basics
The configuration, called a `playbook`, consists of any number of `plays`.

```yml
##
# automatically create branches when issues are assigned
##
branchName: # convention to name new branches when issues are assigned
branches:
  - label: {{label}} # you can have issues with certain label clone from different source branch
    name: {{source branch}} # name of the source branch, default is "default" branch of repository
    prefix: {{valid prefix}} # prefix for newly created branch
##
# automatically close issues that have lacking information from author
##
needsInfo:
  needsInfoLabel: {{label}} # issues needing information have this label
  closeComment: # closing comment to close the issue
  daysUntilClose: # days to wait before closing the issue
##
# automatically perform validations on issues and pull requests 
##
hydrabot:
  - when: {{event}}, {{event}} # can be one or more
    validate:
      # list of validators. Specify one or more.
      - do: {{validator}}
        {{option}}: # name of an option supported by the validator.
          {{sub-option}}: {{value}} # an option will have one or more sub-options.
    pass: # list of actions to be executed if all validation passes. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}
    fail: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validation fails. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}
    error: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validator throws an error. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}
##
# automatically deploy when labels are assigned
##
deploy:
  {{label}}:
    environment: # deploy to which github environment
    description: # description for the environment
    transient_environment:
    auto_merge: # deploy even when merge conflict with default branch
    required_contexts:
      - {{context}} # required checks before deploying
    payload:
      port:
      https:
```

### Create issue branch plays

```yml
branchName: tiny | short | full | custom
branches: 
  - label: enhancement
    name: dev
    prefix: feature/
```

Read more on [create issue branch configuration](docs/create-issue-branch.md)

### Deployment plays

```yml
deploy:
  deploy-to-test: # triggers deployment when this label given to PR
    environment: test # supported github environments
    description: testing environment # a description on environment
    transient_environment: true
    auto_merge: false # if true, triggers deploy even if merge conflict with master
    required_contexts: # required CI checks. If any fail, deployment is not triggered
      - continuous-integration/travis-ci/push
    payload:
      port: 8080
      https: true
```

### Validator plays

```yml
hydrabot:
  - when: {{event}}, {{event}} # can be one or more
    validate:
      # list of validators. Specify one or more.
      - do: {{validator}}
        {{option}}: # name of an option supported by the validator.
          {{sub-option}}: {{value}} # an option will have one or more sub-options.
    pass: # list of actions to be executed if all validation passes. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}
    fail: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validation fails. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}
    error: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validator throws an error. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}
```
Read more on [validators, events and actions](docs/validators.md)


### Needs Info plays

```yml
needsInfo:
  daysUntilClose: 10
  # Label requiring a response
  needsInfoLabel: needs-info
  # Comment to post when closing an Issue for lack of response. Set to `false` to disable
  closeComment: >
    This issue has been automatically closed because there has been no response to our request for more information from the original author.
```
Read more on [auto-close issues lacking information with Hydrab0t](docs/validators.md)

# Commands

## Label manager

Use the `/label` slash command to label an issue with a label

```
/label needs-info
```

Use the `/remove` slash command to label an issue with a comma delimited list of labels.

```
/remove needs-info
```

## Set Reminders

Hydrab0t lets you set reminders to remind you for a particular event in the time provided by you. To do this you can use the Hydrab0t `/remind` command.

```
/remind me to comment on the issue in 30 minutes
```

Hydrab0t adds a `reminder` ‚è∞ label to the **issue** or **pull request** upon receiving this command and reminds you when the specified time has elapsed

Note: _These time intervals are counted based on the UTC time but will still be relevant_
